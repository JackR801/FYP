            <br><br>
            GPUs excel at performing repetitive calculations simultaneously, making them well-suited for parallel operations.

            A common GPU example is graphics rendering. GPUs are central to rendering high-quality images and videos. They manage shading, lighting, and texturing to create realistic visuals in video games, movies, and other visual content. Video games have become more computationally intensive, with hyperrealistic graphics and vast, complicated in-game worlds. With advanced display technologies, such as 4K screens and high refresh rates, along with the rise of virtual reality gaming, demands on graphics processing are growing fast. GPUs are capable of rendering graphics in both 2D and 3D. With better graphics performance, games can be played at higher resolution, at faster frame rates, or both.

          The graphics processing unit, or GPU, has become one of the most important types of computing technology, both for personal and business computing. Designed for parallel processing, the GPU is used in a wide range of applications, including graphics and video rendering. Although they’re best known for their capabilities in gaming, GPUs are becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence (AI).

GPUs were originally designed to accelerate the rendering of 3D graphics. Over time, they became more flexible and programmable, enhancing their capabilities. This allowed graphics programmers to create more interesting visual effects and realistic scenes with advanced lighting and shadowing techniques. Other developers also began to tap the power of GPUs to dramatically accelerate additional workloads in high performance computing (HPC), deep learning, and more.
          <br><br>
          The GPU evolved as a complement to its close cousin, the CPU (central processing unit). While CPUs have continued to deliver performance increases through architectural innovations, faster clock speeds, and the addition of cores, GPUs are specifically designed to accelerate computer graphics workloads. When shopping for a system, it can be helpful to know the role of the CPU vs. GPU so you can make the most of both.
          <br><br>
          While the terms GPU and graphics card (or video card) are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle distinction between these terms. Much like a motherboard contains a CPU, a graphics card refers to an add-in board that incorporates the GPU. This board also includes the raft of components required to both allow the GPU to function and connect to the rest of the system.

GPUs come in two basic types: integrated and discrete. An integrated GPU does not come on its own separate card at all and is instead embedded alongside the CPU. A discrete GPU is a distinct chip that is mounted on its own circuit board and is typically attached to a PCI Express slot.

              While all GPU's are made of the same parts at different levels, many would forget to note that a Nvidea GPU can be changed or shaped by other companies with their own technologies which can result in a multitude of different versions of the same GPU architecture.
              <br><br>
              A GPU is most comprised of a graphics processing unit, VRAM, VRM, Cooling systems, a PCLe interface, an interconnection interface, a video bios, an output interface and also potentially RGB lighting.

                    <h2>Nvidia</h2> <br><br><p>

                      NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an American semiconductor company and a leading global manufacturer of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Based in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA holds approximately 80% of the global market share in GPU semiconductor chips as of 2023.<br><br>

</p><div style="float: left; padding-right: 1rem;" class="sketchfab-embed-wrapper"> <iframe title="Nvidia Logo.Free, high polly" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking" xr-spatial-tracking execution-while-out-of-viewport execution-while-not-rendered web-share width="340" height="280" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/920ee4f7d7a44517a594aff7e852f798/embed?autospin=1&autostart=1&camera=0&ui_hint=0&dnt=1"> </iframe> </div><p>

  Having established itself as one of the world’s leading chip producers specializing in GPU technology, NVIDIA also positioned itself as one of the main suppliers of both AI hardware and software. Its breakout moment in the industry took place in 2022, when OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI chatbot became available to the general public. OpenAI developed its technology using a supercomputer powered by 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs.<br><br>

  NVIDIA’s focus on GPU technology, in contrast to the prevailing CPU technology, was a key factor in establishing both its market differentiation and competitive advantages.

  Whether by design or inherent capacity and improvement, GPU technology excels at parallel processing—utilizing more cores in order to allow multiple processes to run simultaneously. In comparison, CPUs utilize serial processing, which generally requires the completion of one process before the next one can begin.
  
  By concentrating its research and production on GPUs, NVIDIA significantly advanced chip capacity within the semiconductor industry. <br><br>

                      <h2>GPU vs. Graphics Card: What’s the Difference?</h2><br><br>

                      While the terms GPU and graphics card (or video card) are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle distinction between these terms. Much like a motherboard contains a CPU, a graphics card refers to an add-in board that incorporates the GPU. This board also includes the raft of components required to both allow the GPU to function and connect to the rest of the system.<br><br>

                      GPUs come in two basic types: integrated and discrete. An integrated GPU does not come on its own separate card at all and is instead embedded alongside the CPU. A discrete GPU is a distinct chip that is mounted on its own circuit board and is typically attached to a PCI Express slot.<br><br>

                      <h2>Integrated Graphics Processing Unit</h2><br><br>

                      The majority of GPUs on the market are actually integrated graphics. So, what are integrated graphics and how does it work in your computer? A CPU that comes with a fully integrated GPU on its motherboard allows for thinner and lighter systems, reduced power consumption, and lower system costs.<br><br>

                      Intel® Graphics Technology, which includes Intel® Iris® Xe graphics at the forefront of integrated graphics technology. With Intel® Graphics, users can experience immersive graphics in systems that run cooler and deliver long battery life.<br><br>

                      <h2>Discrete Graphics Processing Unit</h2><br><br>

                      Many computing applications can run well with integrated GPUs. However, for more resource-intensive applications with extensive performance demands, a discrete GPU (sometimes called a dedicated graphics card) is better suited to the job.<br><br>

                      These GPUs add processing power at the cost of additional energy consumption and heat creation. Discrete GPUs generally require dedicated cooling for maximum performance.<br><br>

                      <h2>Nvidia or AMD?</h2><br><br>

                      Let’s make one thing clear. In terms of 4K performance, Nvidia takes the cake. But, if you plan to invest in a high-end 4K capable GPU, you might want to make sure you have one of the best 4K gaming monitors to take advantage of it.
That’s not to say that AMD’s recent offerings are sub-par by any means. The AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT, for instance, delivers impressive gaming performance, and has a healthy competitive edge when it comes to pricing.

However, if you’re looking for the best gaming PC performance possible and money isn’t an issue, you probably want an Nvidia graphics card like the RTX 4080. While AMD cards are cheaper, cards such as the AMD RX 7800 XT can’t keep up with Nvidia’s top offering.
<br><br>
Although the RX 7000 series features impressive ray tracing, it falls behind Nvidia’s RTX 40 series in terms of ray tracing performance. And its upscaling tech, FSR, or FidelityFX Super Resolution, hasn't quite caught up with the capabilities of Nvidia’s DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling.

This comes down to the fact that DLSS 3 uses temporal AI upscaling, whereas FSR 3 merely uses temporal upscaling. DLSS 3 provides a superior image quality and performance boost, which FSR 3 cannot match in its current form.
<br><br>
With DLSS 3, Nvidia has implemented AI-powered frame generation, which works in real-time and can effectively double the frame rate. The graphical and performance improvements this technology brings to the table means that Nvidia still leads the charge when it comes to upscaling.

Many consumers tend to choose an AMD graphics card if they have an AMD processor, due to the popular belief that AMD hardware works better together. In reality both AMD and Nvidia GPUs will perform well with either an Intel or AMD CPU.

However, in terms of overall prowess, Nvidia clearly still has the upper hand when it comes to gaming performance.
<br><br>
For raw performance power, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is unbeatable right now, by a country mile. However, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX makes for a cheaper alternative if you find yourself needing to make a compromise between price and performance.

                      <h2>The GPU is only one of the most important purchases of your build</h2><br><br>

                      There was a time when your choice of GPU could have a heavy toll on your PC's performance, but these days, the actual difference is almost non-existent unless you go really low-end.<br><br>

                      We first need to examine why these motherboards are so expensive in the first place. The short story is, while a lot of it is just branding and hype, expensive motherboards do have a few legitimate advantages.<br><br>

                      For one, expensive motherboards will almost always throw in everything and the kitchen sink. This means that you'll often see features and motherboard parts like Thunderbolt 4, PCIe Gen 5 ports (both actual PCI Express slots and m.2 slots) all around, DDR5 RAM, several USB ports, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and amazing onboard audio. The motherboard itself is also thicker and accommodates more complex PCB traces, in order to allow for faster connectivity all around the board. <br><br>

                      Those things are neat, but you really don't need them. At least, not all of them. Still, for the right people, it has a few neat perks you can take advantage of. In the case of some ASUS ROG motherboards, you have something called "DIMM.2," which gives you an extra DIMM slot (not compatible with RAM) that can be used for extra m.2 NVMe SSDs thanks to a special adapter. <br><br>

                      There's no need to match your high-end CPU with an equally expensive motherboard. As long as it has reliable VRMs and connectivity, you'll do well. The technical differences between B660 and Z690 motherboards in the case of Intel or B550 and X570 motherboards in the case of AMD come down to the higher-end chipsets supporting more PCIe Gen 5/4 lanes and overclocking support. That's pretty much it. You won't see a performance drop running your Core i9 or Ryzen 9 on a lower-end chipset. <br><br>

                      Most features you want to care about will come from your actual motherboard choice or manufacturer rather than your chipset. In fact, as a good rule of thumb, if you're given the choice, it's actually better to buy a good B660/B550 motherboard than a cheaper Z690/X570 motherboard. You'll likely have a better and more stable experience with the lower-end chipset in those scenarios. <br><br>

                      While spending more money on your motherboard was once a worthwhile investment, nowadays the actual technical differences between most cheap and expensive motherboards mean that you can get away with a well-researched, cheaper option and have an experience that's 99% as good as the one you'll have with an expensive option.<br><br>

                      Hopefully, you can now make a more educated purchase. <br><br>

                      <h2>Should I buy second-hand?</h2>

                      Motherboards have a lot of elements to them, from capacitors to chips, heatsinks, jumpers, and batteries. If any part were to fail, it's hard to predict what would happen. It might be completely fine, or the whole motherboard might just not work at all. Make sure the motherboard is in complete working order before you buy it. <br><br>

                      <strong>Excercise extreme caution.</strong>

        <p>
          GPU's differ in sizes much like other parts that want to fit in ATX, m-ATX and ITX cases, however GPU's in particular can come in all shapes and forms of sizes so it's a general rule of thumb to measure or find a measurement of the GPU you want and compare it to your PC case to make sure it fits, or check PC Part Picker for compatability.<br><br>
