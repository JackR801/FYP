              Motherboards are circuit boards that distribute electricity and provide communication links to all components of your PC. They can vary in both </p></div><p style="margin-top: -1rem;">colours and sizes. When building a PC, motherboards  are the base of all your components- almost all components slot into the motherboard in one way or another (GPU, CPU, RAM, SSD, etc.) and the rest are plugged in using the relevant cables. Motherboards are held upright in the PC Case using struts, these struts are set into the inner back of the PC Case.
              <br><br>
              While motherboards are typically built with certain slots, sockets and functions as standard, some boards market themselves on built in RGB, extra slots for storage or extra PCLE-slots, or some have more updated designs such as DDR5 RAM compatability, etc.
              <br><br>
              </p></div><p>Motherboards are one of the most crucial parts to a PC Build. Many parts revolve around the type of motherboard a user has- <strong>such as AMD and Intel CPU's only being compatible with certain motherboard CPU sockets,</strong> DDR4 ram being unsupported on DDR5 socket motherboards, etc. Find out more below in <a href="#content5" style="color: #DA3A57;">different types of motherboards</a> and <a href="#content7" style="color: #DA3A57;">other bits</a> 
              <br><br>
              On top of this, there are motherboards in all kinds of shapes, sizes, socket types and brands. <strong>Many motherboards come in the form factors of M-ATX (small), ATX (shown above) and ITX (or Micro-ITX)- all of which correspond to the motherboards physical size which can cause problems when in relation to the size of your PC case if not planned for.</strong> As well as this, different motherboard types offer different pros and cons which you can find below in <a href="#content5" style="color: #DA3A57;">different types of motherboards</a> different brand and practices leaves no two motherboards the same all the way down to installation- in which many companies expect users to refer to their products specific instruction manual over all else.

            A motherboard (mainboard, main circuit board, MB, mboard, backplane board, base board, system board, mobo, or, in Apple computers, logic board) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.
            <br><br>
            Motherboard means specifically a PCB with expansion capabilities. As the name suggests, this board is often referred to as the mother of all components attached to it, which often include peripherals, interface cards, and daughterboards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, host bus adapters, TV tuner cards, IEEE 1394 cards, and a variety of other custom components. 
            <br><br>
            Similarly, the term mainboard describes a device with a single board and no additional expansions or capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers, television sets, washing machines, mobile phones, and other embedded systems with limited expansion abilities.

                Motherboards mainly comprise of a main CPU Socket typically found in the upper middle of the board for your CPU, along with DIMM Slots for RAM to the right of this, VRM's both above and below the CPU Socket, I/O Ports to the far left of the CPU Socket which hold your USB, HDMI, DisplayPort and audio in & out jacks as well as any other slots your motherboard comes equipped with.
                <br><br>
                M.2 Slots are below the CPU socket for SSD's, and below this is the PCle x16 Slot for your GPU. As well as this you will also find headers for USB's, SATA Ports for Storage, a System Panel Header for your cases front-end buttons and sockets (On Button), HD Audio Headers, a CMOS Battery (used for internal memory such as keeping the time during power off), the CPU Power Connector, the Motherboard Power Connector and the fan headers for fans.

                        One of the first an most important things to check when buying a motherboard, or inversely a CPU, RAM kit or PC Case, is to <strong>make sure that the CPU socket and other connectors in the motherboard are compatable with the CPU and other parts you plan to use with it.</strong> Which brings us to some of the first choices a PC builder must make- Intel or AMD?<br><br>

                        <h2>Who is AMD and Intel?</h2><br><br>

                        AMD and Intel are two of the most iconic names in PC building, and for good reason. For decades, they’ve been duking it out to offer the fastest, most capable, and most feature-rich processors (CPU's) for gamers, casual web browsers, and professionals alike. They’ve gone back and forth a few times over the years, with AMD launching groundbreaking designs and Intel responding with revolutionary chips of its own, but what has this to do with motherboards?<br><br>

                        Motherboards are built with certain types of CPU's in mind- and both Intel and AMD have their own propriatory CPU socket designs- AMD use AM4 and AM5 (and many more) while Intel use LGA 1700 (and also many more) for certain CPU's. You have a 13th generation Intel i5 CPU (more found in our <a href="cpu.html" style="color: #DA3A57;">CPU parts page</a>)? Then you need a motherboard with an LGA 1700 CPU socket! Confusing? Very much so, but thats where the internet comes in to help.<br><br>

                        <h2>PC Part Picker</h2><br><br>

                        <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" style="color: #DA3A57;">PC Part Picker</a> is a website that allows users to make a list of their PC parts they want to build with while the website scans and checks for possible incompatable parts and flags it to you- or actively does not suggest parts that are incompatable. Before building your PC, it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> whether you are new or a pro to check PC Part Picker for possible issues with your build down the line. This helps you to nullify the odds of buying a motherboard and finding out that your CPU is incompatable, or that your case is too big, or you rpower source is too weak, etc.<br><br>

                        That being said, what actually is a cpu socket?<br><br>

                        <h2>CPU Socket</h2><br><br>

                        A socket is the array of pins and the securing mechanism that hold a processor in place and connect the motherboard to the available processing power. There are different sockets depending on what generation CPU is supported. If a situation should occur where the CPU and socket aren't compatible, the best case scenario is that the component won't physically be able to connect with the socket, while the worst case may be irreparable damage to either system part.<br><br>

                        Luckily, it's easy to figure out and check whether or not a CPU you're looking at will work with a specific motherboard. Usually, it's recommended to choose the CPU first, which provides you with the socket it requires, making buying a motherboard that little bit simpler. For example, a new Ryzen 5 3600X will require an AM4 motherboard, while an Intel Core i5-9600K will need one with LGA 1151.<br><br>

                        So the sockets on motherboards differentiate the CPU you can combine with them, if you havent already checked PC Part Picker you may be wondering what else can differentiate a motherboard from others:<br><br>

                        <h2>RAM Slots</h2><br><br>

                        RAM slots are often found in pairs and are sometimes color-coded for identification. We should note that RAM slots in a desktop look different than RAM slots in a laptop. A RAM module is rectangular and has a connector on one of the long sides. <br><br>

                        Typically, motherboards have a total of 4 RAM slots or two pairs when they are dual-channel. Some high-end motherboards may contain as many as eight slots, and in supercomputers, there may be multiple motherboards per system, up to 32 slots total (more in our<a href="ram.html" style="color: #DA3A57;">RAM parts page</a>).<br><br>

                        DDR5 has a different pin layout than DDR4 motherboard. Both modules have key notches to lock them in place in the motherboard’s DIMM slot, but the pin layout on a DDR5 RAM module is different compared to a DDR4 module. The key notch locations on both RAM sticks look very similar at first glance, but if you stack them side by side, you will notice that the key notch on the DDR5 module is positioned more to the left, while the DDR4 is more to the right. <strong>This means if you plan to use DDR5 RAM, you need a motherboard with DDR5 Slots</strong> similar to the CPU socket.<br><br>

                        This can also be checked in advance in PC Part Picker.<br><br>

                        <h2>Sata or SSD</h2><br><br>

                        When considering buying a motherboard you may to need consider the number of SATA ports you’ll need, SATA is a form of hardrive storage. Each SATA port allows you to connect an optical drive and storage drives, like a SSD or HDD. So it’s important to make sure your motherboard has all the SATA ports you need for all of your drives. It is also worth noting that you need to make sure your motherboard offers the SATA 6 gigabytes standard, which is also known as SATA 3.0. Furthermore, you might need to consider peripheral connections, for example a USB 3.0.<br><br>

                        <h2>Other features</h2><br><br>

                        If you buy a motherboard with features already built in, you don’t have to worry about buying additional expansion cards. A more common feature which is usual included on the majority of motherboards is on-board audio. However this is usually only suitable for mid-range speakers. It <strong>is worth noting that better motherboards often bundle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth features as well</strong> (yes your PC does not come equipped with the ability to connect to the internet immediately! Many motherboards offer external antenna's for this or specifically have this built in), but you’ll have to spend more cash for these features. Nevertheless they will reduce the need for expansion cards.<br><br>

                        and last but certainly not least.<br><br>

                        <h2>Form Factor</h2>

                        Initially you’ll need to select a form factor. ATX motherboards are common, as is micro ATX (although these are smaller in size and reduce the number of expansions slots). When you’re buying a new motherboard and not sure what size will fit, you can always measure your old motherboard and compare it with different sizes. The ATX board is popular, as it has the addition of more expansion slots, which can be useful.<br><br>

                        <h2>Why you don't need an expensive motherboard- but don't buy just any motherboard!</h2><br><br>

                        There was a time when your choice of motherboard could have a heavy toll on your PC's performance, but these days, the actual difference is almost non-existent unless you go really low-end.<br><br>

                        We first need to examine why these motherboards are so expensive in the first place. The short story is, while a lot of it is just branding and hype, expensive motherboards do have a few legitimate advantages.<br><br>

                        For one, expensive motherboards will almost always throw in everything and the kitchen sink. This means that you'll often see features and motherboard parts like Thunderbolt 4, PCIe Gen 5 ports (both actual PCI Express slots and m.2 slots) all around, DDR5 RAM, several USB ports, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and amazing onboard audio. The motherboard itself is also thicker and accommodates more complex PCB traces, in order to allow for faster connectivity all around the board. <br><br>

                        Those things are neat, but you really don't need them. At least, not all of them. Still, for the right people, it has a few neat perks you can take advantage of. In the case of some ASUS ROG motherboards, you have something called "DIMM.2," which gives you an extra DIMM slot (not compatible with RAM) that can be used for extra m.2 NVMe SSDs thanks to a special adapter. <br><br>

                        There's no need to match your high-end CPU with an equally expensive motherboard. As long as it has reliable VRMs and connectivity, you'll do well. The technical differences between B660 and Z690 motherboards in the case of Intel or B550 and X570 motherboards in the case of AMD come down to the higher-end chipsets supporting more PCIe Gen 5/4 lanes and overclocking support. That's pretty much it. You won't see a performance drop running your Core i9 or Ryzen 9 on a lower-end chipset. <br><br>

                        Most features you want to care about will come from your actual motherboard choice or manufacturer rather than your chipset. In fact, as a good rule of thumb, if you're given the choice, it's actually better to buy a good B660/B550 motherboard than a cheaper Z690/X570 motherboard. You'll likely have a better and more stable experience with the lower-end chipset in those scenarios. <br><br>

                        While spending more money on your motherboard was once a worthwhile investment, nowadays the actual technical differences between most cheap and expensive motherboards mean that you can get away with a well-researched, cheaper option and have an experience that's 99% as good as the one you'll have with an expensive option.<br><br>

                        Hopefully, you can now make a more educated purchase. <br><br>

                        <h2>Should I buy second-hand?</h2>

                        Motherboards have a lot of elements to them, from capacitors to chips, heatsinks, jumpers, and batteries. If any part were to fail, it's hard to predict what would happen. It might be completely fine, or the whole motherboard might just not work at all. Make sure the motherboard is in complete working order before you buy it. <br><br>

                        <strong>Excercise extreme caution.</strong>

          <p>
            Since high speed CPU's generate a lot of heat, there are heat sinks and mounting points for fans right next to the CPU socket on the motherboard<br><br>

            When building your PC, if you have and I/O or onn button + USB/Type C connectors on the front of your PC Case, you actually need to hook these up to your motherboard to even turn it on! However, holding a screwdriver on the I/O header pins found on the motherboard will also work to turn on the PC, as long as the Power is connected of course.<br><br>

            Overclocking is when a user trys to unlock maximum performance of their PC while preventing damage to their hardware. It is discouraged for newcomers and is a skill reserved for experienced users as you’ll need to keep a close eye on your system and make sure your computer doesn’t begin to malfunction. In order to overclock in the first place, a PC must have an overclockable motherboard and CPU.<br><br>
